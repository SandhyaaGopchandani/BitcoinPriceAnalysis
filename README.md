# Bitcoin Historical Price  Analysis
  - In this project, I am analyzing the Bitcoin price dataset to find out the patterns in price changes. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory) is available online on Kaggle. The analysis is done in Python using Jupyter notebook. In order to run this project, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/ and run .ipynb file available on the Github. The folder contains a python notebook file, HTML file as well as report that would illustrate the results of my analysis.
